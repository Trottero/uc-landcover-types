# uc-landcover-types

Urban computing 2021 course project created by Matthias Aarnoutse and Niels Witte. This project revolves around measuring the performance loss in downstream tasks when using a cloudremoval tool [DSen2-CR](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn#introduction)

# Datasets

This folder contains all of the datasets used during the project.

-   `Cloudy` 2 SAR + 13 Sentinel-2 bands of images with clouds
-   `Cloudy-removed` 13 Restored bands as generated by `DSen-CR2`
-   `Eurosat` 13 band dataset used to create the ground-truth classifier
-   `Pristine-cloudless` 13 band dataset to use as a means of creating a ground truth dataset

For `Cloudy` and `Pristine-cloudless` we will be using de data from [here](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1554803) specifically only the summer dataset

-   `ROIs1868_summer_s1.tar.gz`
-   `ROIs1868_summer_s2_cloudy.tar.gz`
-   `ROIs1868_summer_s2.tar.gz`

For the eurosat dataset which is used to train our classifier [here](https://github.com/phelber/eurosat) it is included in tensorflow, see [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/eurosat)

# Running the code

Code can be ran using the notebooks in classification or using the scripts in gen-cloudless.

Some of the code requires tensorflow 1.x, for which a seperate branch is used!
